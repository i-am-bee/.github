**BeeAI** provides the tools and infrastructure to build reliable, intelligent AI agents with deterministic control. Our ecosystem combines a lightweight framework for building agents that enforce rules with a platform for testing, debugging, and deploying them.

## beeai-framework

Build reliable, intelligent agents with our lightweight framework that goes beyond prompting and enforces rules.

[Framework Documentation →](https://framework.beeai.dev)

### Key Features
- 🔀 Dynamic workflows - Use simple decorators to design multi-agent systems with advanced patterns like parallelism, retries, and replanning
- ⚖️ Agents with constraints - Preserve your agent's reasoning abilities while enforcing deterministic rules instead of suggesting behavior
- 📋 Declarative orchestration - Define complex agent systems in YAML for more predictable and maintainable orchestration
- 📊 Pluggable observability - Integrate with your existing stack in minutes with native OpenTelemetry support for auditing and monitoring
- 💻 Python and TypeScript support - Feature parity between languages lets teams build with the tools they already know and love
- 🔌 MCP and A2A native - Build MCP-compatible components, equip agents with MCP tools, and interoperate with any MCP or A2A agent

## beeai-platform

Test, debug, and share your agents in an interactive UI with out-of-the-box trajectory, citations, and more.

[Platform Documentation →](https://docs.beeai.dev)

### Key Features
- ⚡ Instant agent UI - Generate a shareable front-end from your code in minutes. Focus on your agent's logic, not UI frameworks
- ☁️ Effortless deployment - Go from container to production-ready. We handle database, storage, scaling, and RAG so you can focus on your agent
- 🎮 Multi-provider playground - Test across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, IBM watsonx, Ollama and more. Instantly compare performance and cost to find the optimal model
- 🌐 Framework-agnostic - Run agents from LangChain, CrewAI, BeeAI and more on a single platform. Enable cross-framework collaboration without rewriting your code
