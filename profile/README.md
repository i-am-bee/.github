<h2 align="left">Powering the future of open-source AI agent development</h2>

---

The mission of **[BeeAI](https://beeai.dev/)** is building an open-source ecosystem that empowers developers to **discover, run, and compose AI agents** from any framework. We‚Äôre creating the infrastructure to make agents truly **interoperable**, regardless of their underlying implementation. 

## Why BeeAI

The AI agent ecosystem is **fragmented**, with dozens of frameworks creating silos that limit interoperability. BeeAI changes this by:
- üîì Eliminating vendor lock-in, letting you compose multi-agent workflows from different sources
- ‚ö° Speeding up development by using existing agents instead of starting from scratch
- üåç Making it easier to share and discover community-built agents to solve common problems 

## Core components

- **[BeeAI platform](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai)** - The platform to easily discover, run, and compose AI agents from any framework.
- **[BeeAI framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework)** - The SDK for building production-grade AI agents in either Python or TypeScript.
- **[Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://docs.beeai.dev/acp/alpha/introduction)** - The standard for agent-to-agent communication, built for automation, collaboration, and UI integration.
